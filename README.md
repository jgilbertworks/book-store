## Objective 

I wanted to create a MERN stack application that allows the user to search and save books.  Utilizing Google's API & MongoDB, I allow the user to post, delete, and read from the database.

## Code Structure

Utilizing React, I was able to generate components that together, build the application.  My components help generate modular code that allows me to pinpoint and modify a specific feature.  The src folder contains all of my components and my front-end API calls.  The root contains all of my backend functionality.  The index.js runs the server and requires the routes.  The routes handle the API calls from the front-end and calls the controller.  The controller calls the model to handle the post, delete, and read features to send back the data to the front-end.
